same issue here, updating DNS resolver fixs it, but I used systemd config instead of directly modify /etc/resolv.conf (you might forget this line: This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit. crab)

update your /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

add something like this:

[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
FallbackDNS=8.8.4.4
restart the service:

sudo service systemd-resolved restart
verify the dns revolver:

systemd-resolve --status | grep 'DNS Servers' -A2
